## PROFILE

 I have been in the IT industry for 40 years. After an initial training period where I gained the basic programming skills I spent 10 years doing mostly contract work. Over the past 25 years I have established and managed 4 software technology companies. During this time I was able to maintain a high level of technical involvement in all the projects, from conceptualisation and architectural design through coding and implementation.

As one of the early adopters of the Scala language, I have a deep understanding and experience in Reactive and Functional programming paradigms, with a special interest in the compositional nature of Petri Nets and how it can be applied in the development of Decentralized Application (dApps)

Recently my focus has been on developing a Decentralised Marketplace Platform utilising SSI and Smart Contract technology.
